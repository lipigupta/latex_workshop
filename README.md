# LaTeX Workshop Materials


This workshop has been taught several times in various forms. These are the basic materials for the workshop. 

Included is the PowerPoint presentation with an introduction to LaTeX, and some basic tools. The workshop then includes an interactive portion, where participants can follow along. 

## How to Follow Along

I suggest asking all participants to download and install a LaTeX compiler on their computer, or use an online compiler. I prefer to use [Overleaf]{https://www.overleaf.com} personally. If participants want to use Overleaf, they are encouraged to make an account before the workshop in order to upload the materials beforehand. 

Other options include installing a local distribution from [The LaTeX Project]{https://www.latex-project.org/get/#tex-distributions}.
